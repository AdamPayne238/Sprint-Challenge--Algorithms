## Exercise I

a)
O(n^3)

b)
O(n^2)

c)
O(n-1)

## Exercise II

for every floor possible from floor zero to number of floors
if the floor we are on is greater than or equal to f
the egg will break at this floor so we will not drop the egg
otherwise if the floor is less than f we will drop the egg
this will reduce the amount of eggs broken because we will not drop from 
floors which we know the egg will break and will not drop from higher than that floor
because the egg will surely break.
